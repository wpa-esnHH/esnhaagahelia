        description: "You should bring normal clothes and shoes that you are used to wearing since the weather during the late spring, summer and early autumn is not different to that of mainland European countries. In addition, you need to be prepared for the winter. A good pair of waterproof shoes, a warm winter coat, woolen jumpers, thick warm socks, a scarf, pair of gloves and a woolen hat that also covers your ears will be needed. All of these items can also be bought in Finland of course. Hypermarkets offer good value and sell a wide range of such items during the season. Finnish buildings, including schools are well heated and you should bear this in mind when dressing for school in winter. When considering shoes, you should also ensure that the base of the shoe has a good and strong grip. Streets of Helsinki are frequently cleared of snow and therefore it is not essential to have boots. When cleared of snow, the streets easily become covered with a layer of ice - a shoe with a smooth base will not support you on the ice."

        description: "Finland has three official languages: Finnish is the majority language and Swedish is spoken by about 6% of Finns. A minority population in Lapland speaks Lappish. In and around the large cities, especially in Helsinki, you should be able to deal with much of your everyday business in English especially with younger people. If you have knowledge of the Swedish language, you should note that some words might differ because of the Finnish-Swedish dialect. The Finnish-Swedish accent is also considerably different to the accent of Swedes in Sweden."

        description: "In Finland you will visibly notice all four seasons, the longest of which seems to be winter but the light and warm days of summer soon make up for the coldness of the darker season. You may have heard stories about the depressing darkness during the winter. Luckily, even during the darkest months southern Finland receives natural light from around 09:00 - 15:30 while in the north of Finland a couple of hours of light is more likely the case. In the summertime, this will be the other way around, when our days are much longer, and during midsummer, the sun does not set at all! The temperature in Helsinki reaches up to the high twenties (degrees Celsius) in the summer months, and about +10 to +15 during spring. As winter approaches, the temperature starts to fall below 10 degrees during September and October. By November the snow often begins to fall - usually not melting away until April. The coldest winter month is February where the average daily temperature can reach -6 to -15 degrees. There may be even be the odd day where the temperature in Helsinki falls below - 20 degrees and sometimes even more. The wind can chill the air even more so be sure to wrap up in warm and wear protective clothes on a winter day."

        description: "Together with Denmark, Norway and Sweden, Finland makes up the Nordic group of countries located in Northern Europe. Finland is well connected by air, sea and rail and there are various alternatives to get here. If you arrive in Helsinki during the pick-up days ESN Haaga-Helia tutors will meet you at your point of arrival e.g. airport, ferry terminal, railway station or bus station. Preferably you should arrive on the arrival day recommended to you by your exchange school. On this day ESN Haaga-Helia can guarantee a pick up for you. If you are arriving on another day ESN Haaga-Helia will try to arrange for someone to be there to meet you. You can recognize an ESN Haaga-Helia tutor because they will be wearing their purple ESN Haaga-Helia t-shirt. ESN Haaga-Helia tutors from Porvoo will travel to Helsinki to meet you. Vierumäki students will be helped on the correct bus. When you get picked up ESN Haaga-Helia tutors will take you to your apartment. It is important that you inform ESN Haaga-Helia and the Haaga-Helia International Services your arrival time by filling in the electronic arrival form.",

        description: "When you come to Finland you need to know where to shop, both food as well as clothes and household items. Helsinki, as the capital, boasts a wide range of stores, some expensive, some not. On these pages, we try to tell you about the cheaper alternatives. You'll also find most of the stores mentioned on these pages in Porvoo. In your new student room, you'll find basic furniture such as a bed, desk, chair, wardrobe etc. You will still need to buy some bedding or bring it with you, other things you can find at a hypermarket or household store. In Helsinki you'll also find many well-known clothes stores, sport shops and food stores. There are also a lot of shopping malls in the center, for example Forum and Kamppi. Anyway, you can find shopping centers outside of the city center too, for example, the Itis shopping center in the east of Helsinki (one of the largest shopping centers in the Nordic Countries), which can easily be reached by metro.",
